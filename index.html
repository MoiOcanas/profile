I love how user interfaces work, so I focus a lot on what I learn in doing a good front-end development. That's why I use tools like frameworks or libraries using Javascript as the basic language. Although as a full stack developer I also master the technologies that apply to Javascript as a back end function language. </p><p> I am a boy who loves every aspect of his life. Since I discovered web development at school I knew it was what I wanted to dedicate myself to in my life. Since then I have worked to continue learning more and more. I started my journey using the technologies that were taught to us at school, such as C # and SQL Server for the database. But some time later I realized that there are other ways to develop web pages with simpler and more functional languages. That's when I started using Javascript and understood its usefulness. </p> <p> I currently reside in Mexico, I have a beautiful family, a dog, and many friends with whom I love to share great moments. I love music, food, baseball and as you know, web development. </p> <br> <h3> Recent collaborations </h3> <p> Mexico Industry Magazine <br> 2017 - 2018 <br> Based in Reynosa, Mexico / On site <br> Web developer <br> </p> <h3> Contact me </h3> <p> If you are looking to contact me below, I know we can create amazing things, so I will give you 3 links in which you can contact me (Github, Facebook and my email). </p> </div> </main> <nav> <h4> <a href="https://github.com/MoiOcanas">GitHub</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moises-ocanas-casas-4517b9170/">LinkedIn</a> <a href="mailto:alejandr.ocanas35@gmail.com">Mail</a> </h4> </nav> <script src="profile.d7228d8d.js" async=""></script> </div></body> </html>
