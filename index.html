        <p>
          My full name is Moises Alejandro Ocañas Casas, I'm 21 and I am a full-stack Javascript web developer who has just over a
          year in the labor field in this profession. I love how user interfaces work, so I focus a lot on what I learn in
          doing a good front-end development. That's why I use tools like frameworks or libraries using Javascript as the
          basic language. Although as a full stack developer I also master the technologies that apply to Javascript as a
          back end function language.
          <p>
            I am a boy who loves every aspect of his life. Since I discovered web development at school I knew it was what I wanted to
            dedicate myself to in my life. Since then I have worked to continue learning more and more. I started my journey
            using the technologies that were taught to us at school, such as C # and SQL Server for the database. But some
            time later I realized that there are other ways to develop web pages with simpler and more functional languages.
            That's when I started using Javascript and understood its usefulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently reside in Mexico, I have a beautiful family, a dog, and many friends with whom I love to share great moments.
            I love music, food, baseball and as you know, web development.
          </p>
